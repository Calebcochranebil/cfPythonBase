Exercise 1.7: Finalizing Your Python Program
Learning Goals

? Interact with a database using an object-relational mapper
? Build your final command-line Recipe application


Reflection Questions

1. What is an Object Relational Mapper and what are the advantages of using one?
An Object Relational Mapper is a tool that lets you work with a database using object-oriented programming, making it easier to manage and interact with the data, improving productivity and code readability.

2. By this point, you�ve finished creating your Recipe app. How did it go? What�s something in the app that you did well with? If you were to start over, what�s something about your app that you would change or improve? It went well, I didn�t struggle with too much. I feel like I formatted my code well and was able to create all the necessary steps. If I was to start over, I would try and find ways to make my app more flexible. For instance, I spelt a recipe name wrong. I couldn�t go backward and fix it. I had to finish the whole recipe and then go and edit the recipe.

3. Imagine you�re at a job interview. You�re asked what experience you have creating an app using Python. Taking your work for this Achievement as an example, draft how you would respond to this question. In a recent project for my class, I created a recipe management app using Python. The app utilized the SQLAlchemy library to interact with a MySQL database, enabling users to perform actions like creating, viewing, searching, editing, and deleting recipes. The code included setting up the database, defining a Recipe class, and implementing functions for different recipe operations. The app featured a user-friendly command-line interface with a main menu offering various options for recipe management.
 
4. You�ve finished Achievement 1! Before moving on to Achievement 2, take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far: 
a. What went well during this Achievement? Pretty much everything went well. I learned a lot on how python works on scripts. Following instructions on how to create my recipe app was easy.  
b. What�s something you�re proud of? I�m proud at how fast I was able to learn and get this achievement done.
c. What was the most challenging aspect of this Achievement? The most challenging thing was this achievement and learning ORM. The toughest part of learning ORM was adjusting to a new way of interacting with databases through code, managing speed optimization, and dealing with complex data relationships. Despite these challenges, consistent practice helped me overcome them and become proficient in using ORM effectively.
d. Did this Achievement meet your expectations? Did it give you the confidence to start working with your new Python skills? Id say it laid the groundwork and the only place to go is up. I am confident to start working and continue my learning process.
e. What�s something you want to keep in mind to help you do your best in Achievement 2? I want to keep in mind that I can do hard things. Even if it takes a couple hours my mind will eventually understand and get through the roadblocks of learning code.

Well done�you�ve now completed the Learning Journal for Achievement 1. As you�ll have seen, a little metacognition can go a long way!
